		<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
		
			 <dl>
			    <dt>What questions should I ask a removal company?</dt>
			    <dd>Removals Companies come in all shapes and sizes and the questions you ask should be based on what is important to you - we recommend asking about the following:
			</dd>
			    <dd>Professional qualifications, insurance, length of time trading, customer testimonials</dd>
			   
			    <dt>Why isn't there an instant quote online?</dt>
			    <dd>Your removal job will have specific requirements that removals companies need to take into account when providing a quote which can often only be determined by contacting you by phone or email.</dd>
			    <dd>By having a brief conversation with you to gain a more detailed description of your move (including inventory, parking, access etc) you will get the best and most accurate quote.</dd>
			    
			    
			    <dt>Should I just choose the cheapest quote?</dt>
			    <dd>Our partner companies range in size and therefore there you will receive a range of quotes. Price isn't necessarily the only factor to consider when making your decision.</dd>
			    <dd>For example, companies who have invested in professional qualifications and training may quote slightly higher but will have better qualified staff as a result.</dd>
			<dd>Your decision should take into account all factors important to you, including price.</dd>
			    
			    <dt>How far in advance should I book my move?</dt>
			    <dd>Removal companies often get booked up in advance so our advice is to be prepared and book as far in advance as possible.</dd>
			    <dd>Busy periods such as Fridays, Bank Holidays and School Holidays will always require additional notice.</dd>
			     <dd>Our removers work hard to provide the best quotes with no obligations but once you have booked a move with them, it is important to communicate with them as they will block the time out and turn down other work once they have confirmed a booking.</dd>
			    
			    <dt>How should I prepare for moving?</dt>
			    <dd>Being organised is key so the move goes smoothly!<br />
			For example, if you are packing your own boxes up, then correctly labelling them and having them organised for the removers will save time at the other end.</dd>
